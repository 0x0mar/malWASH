main() function: _main (at 0x411460)

Under BAST/Paranoid modes, thread analysis of malWASH won't find the thread entry point,
so you will need to manually specify it: j_?DestroyWindows@@YGKPAX@Z (0x4111A4)

We need .pdb file. Functions like cout can cause problems under injection.
We don't need them so we remove them from malWASH. To do that we need to know
function names. We can do other things like signature matching as well, but
for now leave the pdb file here.

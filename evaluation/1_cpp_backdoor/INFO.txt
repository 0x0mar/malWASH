Cpp Backdoor (CppServer.exe). See source code for more details.

main() function: _WinMain@16

Arguments (WinMain() style): -k UserService

Use CppClient.exe to connect to the server.

NOTE: I didn't test wipe command as it wipes the disk. I tried commands like:
start ==> c:\windows\system32\calc.exe
shellexecute ==> c:\windows\system32\calc.exe
restart
forceshutdown
...
